This project was designed to allow users to locate a central point from mutliple addresses. Users may input 2 or more addresses, which can be viewed on the map, and find a midpoint that is equidistant from all addresses, along with nearby attractions or places of interest. Users can filter these places using a dropdown list, and view them in order of distance from the midpoint. The web application features a user authentication system to allow users to sign in and save commonly used places such as Home or Work. This personal project was built using Google Maps API, Python, JavaScript, and a Django framework using models.
